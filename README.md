# Experiments-with-Bayesian-Linear-Regression

The goals of this assignment are:  
1. to investigate the eﬀect of the number of examples,the number of features, and the regularization parameter on the performance of the corresponding algorithms  
2. to investigate two methods for model selection in linear regression (evidence maximization and cross validation).
