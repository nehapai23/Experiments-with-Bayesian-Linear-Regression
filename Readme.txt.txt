The main file of the programming project is pp2.py. The three sub-tasks are organized in 3 separate files - task1.py, task2.py, task3.py. These files are internally called by the main file on the basis of the input provided via command line arguments.

To execute the tasks follow the below commands:

1) Execute Task 1: 
PS C:\Neha\Grad Sem 1\Machine Learning\Assignments\Assignment_2> python .\pp2.py <Dataset Name> task1
-> E.g.: PS C:\Neha\Grad Sem 1\Machine Learning\Assignments\Assignment_2> python .\pp2.py wine task1

2) Execute Task 2: 
PS C:\Neha\Grad Sem 1\Machine Learning\Assignments\Assignment_2> python .\pp2.py <Dataset Name> task2
-> E.g.: PS C:\Neha\Grad Sem 1\Machine Learning\Assignments\Assignment_2> python .\pp2.py wine task2

3) Execute Task 3: 
PS C:\Neha\Grad Sem 1\Machine Learning\Assignments\Assignment_2> python .\pp2.py <Dataset Name> task3
-> E.g.: PS C:\Neha\Grad Sem 1\Machine Learning\Assignments\Assignment_2> python .\pp2.py wine task3

Dataset Names to provide as input ->
["wine", "crime", "1000-100", "100-100", "100-10"]

Tasks to provide as input ->
["task1","task2","task3"]

Note: 
1) Only one task is executed at once
2) The datasets are assumed to be in a folder -> "pp2data/filename.csv" in the root folder.  
3) Task 2 displays 3 plots one after the other. Close one to display next plot
